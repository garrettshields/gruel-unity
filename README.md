# gruel-unity

## What is Gruel?
Gruel is:
* A loose collection of resources needed for building games in Unity.
* Highly experimental (for now).
* Built to be easily added as a submodule into Unity projects.

Gruel's development and versioning is based around what I need for my current projects, and when they are completed. As such it may be lacking obvious features you would want for a different project, but I didn't have a need for in mine.

## Should I use Gruel?
I would avoid using Gruel until at least 0.1 has been completed, and try to stick to a release for the entire duration of a project.

## Version
Current version: `0.1.0 is under active development`  
Version formatting: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

* Each release of Gruel will be branched off of master, and the `MINOR` version number will be incremented.
* Breaking changes should only come with each `MINOR` increment.
* `PATCH` releases should always be safe.

gruel-unity 0.1 is currently in development, and will be branched off of master when complete. There is no timeline for this, but it will probably be when I'm done with my current project.
